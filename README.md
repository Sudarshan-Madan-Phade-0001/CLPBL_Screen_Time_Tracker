# CLPBL_Screen_Time_Tracker
Screen Time Tracker is a desktop-focused web application designed to help users stay productive by limiting their access to distracting websites. Users can manually set time limits for specific websites, and once the limit is reached, the site will be automatically blocked via a connected Chrome extension.
